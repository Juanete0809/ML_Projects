# ML_Projects
ML and DL projects

Here I will keep all the different projects I will be working on, to practice and polish my knowledge in data analytics and data science.

I will try to use different techniques for problem solving, from regression and classification algorithms to deep learning models oriented to character 
recognition or computer vision.
